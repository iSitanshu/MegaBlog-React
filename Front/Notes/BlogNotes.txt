Let start creating an application name MegaBlog

$ Part 1

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE - are the file .env (in the root of the vite@latest)
of the project - They allow developers to manage 
sensitive information, like API keys and database 
credentials, without hardcoding them into the source
code. 

1.  More Important step environment variable step - 
on creating a website there must be an application 
which can contact the database - as database contains 
unique client id secret id password - system variable

2. make an environment variable .env (Projet k root mein) 
dont update in github so add to gitignore first 
and write VITE_APPWRITE_URL = "test environment"
and make a sample environment variable

3. Access the environment variable - sabme alag
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL)
ans - test environment

4. add more features in the env file and add value
VITE_APPWRITE_URL = "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1" on creating project
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="66ba3d3a002f66deb5d3" on creating project
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="66ba3e380010ae48293f" on creating database - can be multiple such as blogs, artiles
VITE_APPWRITE_COLLECTION_ID="66ba3e610030d493c285" 
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID="66ba3f7d00324a326508" from Storage
value from appwrite

5. access it okay but make a seperate file to convert the 
values from appwrite to String by - 
const conf = {
    appwriteUrl: String(import.meta.env.VITE_APPWRITE_URL),
    appwriteProjectId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECT_ID),
    appwriteDatabaseId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_DATABASE_ID),
    appwriteCollectionId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_COLLECTION_ID),
    appwriteBucketId: String(import.meta.env.VITE_BUCKET_ID)
}
export default conf

$ Part 2 - Vender Login

SERVICES - Write code such as if wwe have to take out code 
it should be platform independent 
 
rough - we have to create a client, in client haame endpoint aur project chahiye hoga
        
        fir account banta hai par client banne k baad 
        const account = new Account(client)

        account pe method call create jisme id email password dena hoga 
        haame koi bhi encryption ka dhyan nhi rakhna hai aapwrite will took cake of it
